# Design Systems Coalition NYC Meetup
This repository is for anything related to organizing the [Design Systems Coalition meetup in NYC](https://www.meetup.com/NYC-Design-Systems-Coalition/). Organizers and members can use this to share and discuss topic ideas, speaker suggestions, locations for hosting, and ideas for the format of the meetup etc.

## How to get involved with our meetup
We hope to host meetups every 6 to 8 weeks, if you'd like to get invovled, here's how:

### Offer to host a meetup
We hope to host meetups regularly and are looking for companies with spaces that can accommodate 60â€”100 people. Read the [hosting guidelines](https://github.com/design-systems-coalition-NYC/meetup/hosting-guidelines.md) and if you'd like to host one of our meetups, [open a new issue](https://github.com/design-systems-coalition-NYC/meetup/issues/new?milestone=Meetup+venues+and+hosts).

### Suggest speakers, or offer to speak yourself
We want to hear from a diverse range of experiences. We welcome and will support first-time speakers, and people still new to design systems. If you think you have something interesting to share, or there are people or teams you'd like to hear from, [open an issue](https://github.com/design-systems-coalition-NYC/meetup/issues/new?milestone=Speaker+suggestions). Read our [speaker guidelines](https://github.com/design-systems-coalition-NYC/meetup/speaker-guidelines.md) for more details on what we're looking for and what to expect as a speaker.

### Suggest topic ideas
At each meetup we have 3 speakers talk on a single topic related to design systems. If there's a topic you'd like to see covered in a future meetup please suggest your idea by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/design-systems-coalition-NYC/meetup/issues/new?milestone=Topic+ideas).
